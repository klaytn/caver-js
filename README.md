caver-js is a JavaScript API library that allows developers to interact with a
Klaytn node using a HTTP or Websocket connection.

**NOTE**
Kaikas Web Extension Wallet is recommended to be used with [features prior to common architecture](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1). New features provided in caver-js v1.5.0 (introduced common architecrue) or later are currently not compatible with Kaikas.
Kaikas web extension wallet works fine with functions prior to common architecture, so please use [functions prior to common architecture](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1).
Even in the latest version of caver-js, [functions prior to common architecture](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1) are provided for backward compatibility. See [Trouble shooting and known issues](#connect-with-kaikas-web-extension) for more details.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to use the caver-js library.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [gcc-c++](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Testing in caver-js is implemented using the mocha testing framework. If you want to run unit tests in caver-js, you need to install mocha first.
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/#installation)

**Note** caver-js can run on Node.js versions 12 and 14, and the recommended versions are:
- lts/erbium ([12.21.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/))
- lts/fermium ([14.16.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/))

If you are already using a different version of the node(for example, node v15), use the Node Version Manager([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) to install and use the version supported by caver-js.


## Installation

### Node

To try it out, install caver-js with npm like following command:

```
$ npm install caver-js
```

**Note** `package.json` file should exist on the same install path.  If it
does not exist, `package.json` should be generated via `npm init`.

To install a specific version of caver-js, try the following command:
```
$ npm install caver-js@X.X.X
```

### In the Browser

Build using the caver-js repository:

```
$ npm run build
```

Then include `dist/caver.min.js` in your html file. This will expose Caver on the window object.

Or via CDN:

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/caver-js/x.x.x/caver.min.js"></script>
```

The caver-js provided by cdnjs can be found at [this link](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/caver-js).

## Getting Started

If you want to run your own EN (Endpoint Node), see [EN Operation Guide](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/installation-guide/deployment/endpoint-node) to set up. You can connect EN like below:
```
$ node
> const Caver = require('caver-js')
> const caver = new Caver('http://localhost:8551/')
```
**Note** The above example should be executed from the location where caver-js is installed, and the example is explained using [Node.js REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl_the_node_js_repl).

### Check the Connection
You can now use caver-js. You can send a basic request to the node as shown below and check the results.
```
> caver.rpc.klay.getClientVersion().then(console.log)
Klaytn/vX.X.X/linux-amd64/goX.X.X
```

### Using caver-js keyring/wallet

You can easily use your Klaytn account when signing a transaction or message by using the [Keyring] / [wallet].

The keyring is a new feature that contains an address and one or more private keys based on the key types ([SingleKeyring], [MultipleKeyring] or [RoleBasedKeyring]). Refer to [caver.wallet.keyring] for details.
[caver.wallet], the **in-memory wallet**, is provided to easily manage multiple keyrings.

**Note** Functions associated with `wallet` and `keyring` have no effect on the Klaytn blockchain platform. It just manipulates keyrings in the in-memory wallet.

Let's create a random keyring as shown in the example below:
```
> const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.generate()

> keyring
SingleKeyring {
  _address: '0x64d221893cc628605314026f4c4e0879af5b75b1',
  _key: PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key}' }
}
```

You can add the keyring object created in the above example to the caver.wallet, or you can add a keyring using an address and private key(s).
```
// Add a keyring instance to caver.wallet
> caver.wallet.add(keyring)

// Add a keyring to caver.wallet with an address and a private key
> caver.wallet.newKeyring('0x{address in hex}', '0x{private key}')

// Add a keyring to caver.wallet with an address and private keys
> caver.wallet.newKeyring('0x{address in hex}', ['0x{private key1}', '0x{private key2}', ...])

// Add a keyring to caver.wallet with an address and private keys by roles
> caver.wallet.newKeyring('0x{address in hex}', [ ['0x{private key1}', ...], ['0x{private key2}', ...], ['0x{private key3}', ...] ])
```

### Submitting a Transaction
You can use caver-js to submit various types of transactions to a node. Please refer to the [caver.transaction](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/api-references/caver.transaction/#class) to see how to create a transaction of each type.

**Note** you should create a transaction instance via `create` function. From caver-js v1.8.2, constructors per transaction type are not supported.

You can sign the transaction using a keyring and send a signed transaction through `caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction` as shown below, and the receipt is returned as a result.
```
// Add a keyring to caver.wallet
> const keyring = caver.wallet.newKeyring('0x{address in hex}', '0x{private key}')
> const vt = caver.transaction.valueTransfer.create({
		from: keyring.address,
		to: '0x176ff0344de49c04be577a3512b6991507647f72',
		value: caver.utils.convertToPeb(1, 'KLAY'),
		gas: 25000,
	})
> caver.wallet.sign(keyring.address, vt).then(signed => {
  caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction(signed).then(console.log)
})
{ 
  blockHash: '0x0a78b5c5b95456b2d6b6a9ba25fd2afd0000d16bcf03a8ae58a6557a59319a67',
  blockNumber: 8021,
  contractAddress: null,
  from: '0x09a08f2289d3eb3499868908f1c84fd9523fe11b',
  ...
  type: 'TxTypeValueTransfer',
  typeInt: 8,
  value: '0xde0b6b3a7640000' 
}
```

The above example uses `Promise` when sending a signed transaction to the Klaytn. You can also use `event emitter` like below.

```
caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction(signed).on('transactionHash', function(hash){
    ...
  }).on('receipt', function(receipt){
    ...
  })
```

### Units for KLAY
Units of KLAY is shown as below, and `peb` is the smallest currency unit.
`peb` is the default unit unless the unit conversion is used.

| Name | Unit |
| --- | ---: |
| peb | 1 |
| kpeb | 1,000 |
| Mpeb | 1,000,000 |
| Gpeb | 1,000,000,000 |
| ston | 1,000,000,000 |
| uKLAY | 1,000,000,000,000 |
| mKLAY | 1,000,000,000,000,000 |
| KLAY | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 |
| kKLAY | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 |
| MKLAY | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 |
| GKLAY | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 |
| TKLAY | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 |

caver-js provides the caver.utils.convertToPeb function for unit conversion. Please refer to the usage below.
```
> caver.utils.convertToPeb(1, 'peb')
'1'

> caver.utils.convertToPeb(1, 'Gpeb')
'1000000000'

> caver.utils.convertToPeb(1, 'KLAY')
'1000000000000000000'
```

## Web3.js Similarity

Since caver-js has been evolved from web3.js, usage pattern of caver-js is very similar to that of web3.js.	
This means a software developed using web3.js can be easily converted to caver-js.	
The following examples are code patterns used in web3.js and caver-js, respectively.	

```	
const Web3 = require('web3');	
const web3 = new Web3(new web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));	
web3.eth.getBalance('0x407d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1').then(console.log)	
```	

```	
const Caver = require('caver-js');	
const caver = new Caver(new Caver.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));	
caver.rpc.klay.getBalance('0x407d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1').then(console.log)	
```	

## Error Code Improvement


Klaytn improves reporting transaction failure via txError in the receipt.
caver-js further improves the report by presenting the error string that corresponds to txError.

The below is an example of a receipt containing txError.

```
Error: VM error occurs while running smart contract
 {
  "blockHash": "0xe7ec35c9fff1178d52cee1d46d40627d19f828c4b06ad1a5c3807698b99acb20",
  ...
  "txError": "0x2",
  ...
}
```

The meaning of error code can be found below:

| Error Code | Description |
|---|---|
|0x02|VM error occurs while running smart contract|
|0x03|max call depth exceeded|
|0x04|contract address collision|
|0x05|contract creation code storage out of gas|
|0x06|evm: max code size exceeded|
|0x07|out of gas|
|0x08|evm: write protection|
|0x09|evm: execution reverted|
|0x0a|reached the opcode computation cost limit (100000000) for tx|
|0x0b|account already exists|
|0x0c|not a program account (e.g., an account having code and storage)|
|0x0d|Human-readable address is not supported now|
|0x0e|fee ratio is out of range [1, 99]|
|0x0f|AccountKeyFail is not updatable|
|0x10|different account key type|
|0x11|AccountKeyNil cannot be initialized to an account|
|0x12|public key is not on curve|
|0x13|key weight is zero|
|0x14|key is not serializable|
|0x15|duplicated key|
|0x16|weighted sum overflow|
|0x17|unsatisfiable threshold. Weighted sum of keys is less than the threshold.|
|0x18|length is zero|
|0x19|length too long|
|0x1a|nested composite type|
|0x1b|a legacy transaction must be with a legacy account key|
|0x1c|deprecated feature|
|0x1d|not supported|
|0x1e|smart contract code format is invalid|

## Sample Projects

## Trouble shooting and known issues

### Connect with Kaikas Web Extension

Kaikas Web Extension Wallet works normally with [functions prior to common architecture](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1).
Features provided in later versions (caver-js v1.5.0~) may not work with Kaikas Web Extension Wallet.

If the following error occurs when using with Kaikas, it must be modified to use the [functions supported by caver-js v1.4.1](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1).
For compatibility with the latest version, the same [functions provided by caver-js v1.4.0](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1) are provided.

```
Kaikas only processes one transaction at a time. Open Kaikas and refresh the pending transaction. If the service doesn’t process your transaction for a while, cancel the pending transaction.
```

```
Kaikas는 한 번에 하나의 트랜잭션만 처리합니다. Kaikas를 열어 대기 중인 트랜잭션을 새로고침 해주세요. 만약 대기 상태가 계속된다면 이용 중인 서비스가 트랜잭션을 처리하지 않는 것이니 트랜잭션을 취소바랍니다.
```

Although the above error is mostly the case, other errors may occur besides the above error, so if you are using Kaikas Web Extension Wallet, please use the [functions supported by caver-js v1.4.1](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1).
Keep in mind that you **cannot mix features** before and after common architecture.

For documents for the functions supported by caver-js v1.4.1, refer to [caver-js ~v1.4.1 Documentation](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/dapp/sdk/caver-js/v1.4.1).

### Using webpack >= 5

Node.js module polyfills are not provided by default in webpack v5 and later.
Therefore, you need to install the missing modules and add them to the `resolve.fallback` property of the webpack.config.js file in the form below.

```
module.exports = {
    ...
    resolve: {
        fallback: {
            fs: false,
            net: false,
            stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
            crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
            http: require.resolve('stream-http'),
            https: require.resolve('https-browserify'),
            os: require.resolve('os-browserify/browser'),
            ...
        },
    },
}
```

More information on migrating to webpack v5 can be found [here](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/#clean-up-configuration).

If you are implementing an app using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), you can use [react-app-rewired](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired) to add the above polyfills to the webpack.config.js file used by [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/).
More information on using react-app-rewired with create-react-app can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired).
